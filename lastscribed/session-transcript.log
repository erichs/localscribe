2025/01/17 19:16:30 EST - Around the table. Super brief.
2025/01/17 19:16:32 EST - Tell us your character's name.
2025/01/17 19:16:38 EST - What you look like, how you're feeling in the. In the tavern atmosphere tonight, and then.
2025/01/17 19:16:42 EST - If you have a relationship that you'd like to share and it makes sense, go for it.
2025/01/17 19:16:43 EST - Okay.
2025/01/17 19:16:50 EST - Edvard soot. Soot? Otherwise known as Mr. Soot.
2025/01/17 19:16:52 EST - He.
2025/01/17 19:16:53 EST - 's.

2025/01/17 19:17:01 EST - A.
2025/01/17 19:17:03 EST - Hedge illusionist.
2025/01/17 19:17:06 EST - And.
2025/01/17 19:17:09 EST - Is here because.
2025/01/17 19:17:11 EST - He is fleeing.
2025/01/17 19:17:13 EST - One of.
2025/01/17 19:17:15 EST - Many.
2025/01/17 19:17:20 EST - Varnished troops.
2025/01/17 19:17:26 EST - That he tried and did not succeed in joining.
2025/01/17 19:17:27 EST - And so.
2025/01/17 19:17:30 EST - He's here to drown his sorrows, but also to.
2025/01/17 19:17:33 EST - See if he can find another.
2025/01/17 19:17:36 EST - Mark, patsy or otherwise.
2025/01/17 19:17:44 EST - Person in desperate need of somebody that he could potentially be. And so for that person,
2025/01/17 19:17:49 EST - And we rolled on the there.
2025/01/17 19:17:57 EST - He also, because he.
2025/01/17 19:17:58 EST - Had taken.
2025/01/17 19:18:02 EST - So many different jobs there he is now trying to be a debt collector.
2025/01/17 19:18:10 EST - And who can't stop. Let's see. Debt collector who constantly trig memories of. The good old days.
2025/01/17 19:18:11 EST - With.
2025/01/17 19:18:18 EST - Laura with Belora, who?
2025/01/17 19:18:21 EST - How did she get into the debt collection?
2025/01/17 19:18:28 EST - Or maybe he's trying to persuade her to come along.
2025/01/17 19:18:37 EST - He's struck up a conversation. He's trying to persuade you to come along to. Do debt collection.
2025/01/17 19:18:52 EST - I'm playing, say, Laura Thorne Bloom, who's a druid elf who used to. Be a farmer, and I guess she was collecting bets in the small towns around her to make extra money.
2025/01/17 19:18:54 EST - Is my guess.
2025/01/17 19:18:55 EST - Excellent.
2025/01/17 19:18:59 EST - What does failure look like?
2025/01/17 19:19:07 EST - She's a copper skinned elf with black hair.
2025/01/17 19:19:10 EST - About five foot three. Perfect.
2025/01/17 19:19:13 EST - It shows that Ed Bard is a human.
2025/01/17 19:19:20 EST - Those classic villain mustache themes with the twirl.
2025/01/17 19:19:25 EST - Twirling. Twirling it. Perfect. And then a top hat as well.
2025/01/17 19:19:28 EST - It's dressed rather fopishly, Mr. Sok.
2025/01/17 19:19:32 EST - So Arwin flame part.
2025/01/17 19:19:38 EST - Is dressed in very finely polished armor.
2025/01/17 19:19:42 EST - With a very fine cloak.
2025/01/17 19:19:44 EST - Looking.
2025/01/17 19:19:47 EST - Sort of very questionably.
2025/01/17 19:19:50 EST - At the top hat and definitely.
2025/01/17 19:19:53 EST - At the druid next to him.
2025/01/17 19:19:56 EST - He is.
2025/01/17 19:19:57 EST - Tall and thin.
2025/01/17 19:20:01 EST - Has kind of pale gray skin.
2025/01/17 19:20:04 EST - One interesting sort of thing that.
2025/01/17 19:20:09 EST - Immediately sort of catches your attention is eyes, and the pupils, they're just sort of.
2025/01/17 19:20:11 EST - Circles.
2025/01/17 19:20:14 EST - He has black hair and.
2025/01/17 19:20:17 EST - He is an asmr. Paladin. Beautiful.
2025/01/17 19:20:19 EST - We'll move to Kevin.
2025/01/17 19:20:25 EST - Yeah, if you can turn your volume up just a little bit.
2025/01/17 19:20:32 EST - How about that? Perfect.
2025/01/17 19:20:39 EST - It doesn't mute you.
2025/01/17 19:20:46 EST - Good point. I can't hear myself then. Yeah, I would have unmuted. Okay, technical. Confusion. No worries.
2025/01/17 19:20:49 EST - Okay.
2025/01/17 19:20:51 EST - Darjan.
2025/01/17 19:20:54 EST - Is obviously confused. She's about 3ft tall.
2025/01/17 19:21:08 EST - Has kind of, like, walnut colored skin, but it's carrying three gigantic sacks and is wearing some what appears to be boar skin hide armor that's covered in runes.
2025/01/17 19:21:11 EST - But also.
2025/01/17 19:21:21 EST - The facts themselves are spilling out little bits of animal feed, and she's trying to manage. Two different quarter stabs at the same time on top of the rest of the junk files.
2025/01/17 19:21:30 EST - She's kind of looking around a bit of fuddle at the scenario here. Excellent. She's only 3ft tall. Her ears seem to be human.
2025/01/17 19:21:37 EST - But she's decorated her face with the Sam ruins that are on the or hide clothing. Okay.
2025/01/17 19:21:39 EST - Wonderful.
2025/01/17 19:21:43 EST - From Kevin to Jesse.
2025/01/17 19:21:45 EST - All right.
2025/01/17 19:21:48 EST - So.
2025/01/17 19:21:50 EST - Fenin is.
2025/01/17 19:21:56 EST - A burly dwarf with red hair and he dyed.
2025/01/17 19:22:00 EST - A braid that goes around his head.
2025/01/17 19:22:04 EST - Really bright. Bright red. The sides.
2025/01/17 19:22:05 EST - Are.
2025/01/17 19:22:06 EST - Tattooed.
2025/01/17 19:22:09 EST - Bare skin and tattooed.
2025/01/17 19:22:13 EST - With scars basically covering his face.
2025/01/17 19:22:19 EST - He covered in soot from head to toe.
2025/01/17 19:22:23 EST - It looks like he just walked.
2025/01/17 19:22:25 EST - Out of a fireplace.
2025/01/17 19:22:28 EST - Dressed in chain mail.
2025/01/17 19:22:33 EST - He has a battle axe over one shoulder.
2025/01/17 19:22:36 EST - And a battle hammer over the other.
2025/01/17 19:22:38 EST - And.
2025/01/17 19:22:40 EST - Has.
2025/01/17 19:22:43 EST - A large pail.
2025/01/17 19:22:46 EST - With random artisans stuff.
2025/01/17 19:22:50 EST - Or that's tongs.
2025/01/17 19:22:53 EST - And some hammers and.
2025/01/17 19:22:57 EST - Some things to cut metal with. Right on.
2025/01/17 19:23:02 EST - It doesn't look entirely friendly.
2025/01/17 19:23:05 EST - Okay, cool.
2025/01/17 19:23:06 EST - Jane.
2025/01/17 19:23:11 EST - Currently muted.
2025/01/17 19:23:16 EST - Okay? I was unmuted. Can you hear me now? Yeah.
2025/01/17 19:23:23 EST - So iron is a topaz dragonborn.
2025/01/17 19:23:31 EST - With golden scales, but some of them are blackened, so she has a mix of gold and black. Fill.
2025/01/17 19:23:37 EST - And she's just wearing traveling clothes with no armor.
2025/01/17 19:23:48 EST - But she has a great axe flying props her back. But if anyone was to look closely, they could clearly see that this is a brand new never used by the LA.
2025/01/17 19:23:51 EST - And she.
2025/01/17 19:24:02 EST - Has her nose tucked in a Tome of spells, and she is clearly trying to perform some spells. But nothing is happening. Nice.
2025/01/17 19:24:05 EST - Fantastic.
2025/01/17 19:24:08 EST - We'll move from Jane to Ashley.
2025/01/17 19:24:14 EST - So, in contrast to the other, clearly a paladin across the table.
2025/01/17 19:24:16 EST - Shale is.
2025/01/17 19:24:25 EST - A black haired dwarf with her hair very severely braided, just a single brain down her back.
2025/01/17 19:24:33 EST - With rather fresh faced fruit work, very clearly. Pretty young, but still an adult.
2025/01/17 19:24:37 EST - And.
2025/01/17 19:24:48 EST - Wearing chain mail with some. Looks like it was probably a holy symbol at one point, but in coming through the arches, it just doesn't quite look like anything. And was familiar with.
2025/01/17 19:24:55 EST - And leaning up against the wall behind her.
2025/01/17 19:24:58 EST - Are a halbert and a glaze.
2025/01/17 19:25:01 EST - And she's.
2025/01/17 19:25:03 EST - Pretty bristling with weapons.
2025/01/17 19:25:10 EST - Sweet, sweet Joseph.
2025/01/17 19:25:15 EST - Eldovin neferren is.
2025/01/17 19:25:19 EST - A wood elf fighter.
2025/01/17 19:25:20 EST - He's wearing.
2025/01/17 19:25:26 EST - Travelers cloak.
2025/01/17 19:25:35 EST - With an obviously well worn scimitar. She set his side nice, but also hooked onto his belt is a crossbow.
2025/01/17 19:25:39 EST - He is the multidisciplined business fighting.
2025/01/17 19:25:46 EST - He's got a shield strap to his back and a healer skit on his backpack.
2025/01/17 19:25:52 EST - He's.
2025/01/17 19:26:04 EST - Clapping his companion to the left of him on the back while holding up a tentorative ale saying, this one is good. This one is good. What makes it good?
2025/01/17 19:26:09 EST - As he and his companion are ale inventors. Nice.
2025/01/17 19:26:12 EST - Trying to treat the perfect ale.
2025/01/17 19:26:16 EST - They are doing reconnaissance on what makes ale good.
2025/01/17 19:26:23 EST - I am Bananor.
2025/01/17 19:26:26 EST - A cleric dwarf.
2025/01/17 19:26:37 EST - Who? He doesn't know if he's lived from the city or if he came. From a cake. He's just very confused, like, to an unnatural degree.
2025/01/17 19:26:46 EST - Also very lucky. Despite that, he doesn't know how we got here or why he's. Talking with the partner to his right about ale.
2025/01/17 19:26:54 EST - He's just there. He also likes hammers. Looks exactly like a dwarf who likes hammers.
2025/01/17 19:26:57 EST - Excellent, excellent.
2025/01/17 19:26:59 EST - You hear this crash?
2025/01/17 19:27:03 EST - And it sounds like it's coming from the kitchen.
2025/01/17 19:27:04 EST - And you hear.
2025/01/17 19:27:08 EST - Gum. You know you have to announce when you're going out the door.
2025/01/17 19:27:12 EST - What does that even mean?
2025/01/17 19:27:14 EST - You love to wonder.
2025/01/17 19:27:16 EST - What they might mean by that.
2025/01/17 19:27:21 EST - You're enjoying yourselves here at the tavern and.
2025/01/17 19:27:25 EST - You overhear some light gossip?
2025/01/17 19:27:28 EST - There's some gossip around town.
2025/01/17 19:27:31 EST - That.
2025/01/17 19:27:37 EST - Folks are a little. Something's a little off this evening. The Golden Knights.
2025/01/17 19:27:39 EST - Who are.
2025/01/17 19:27:43 EST - The military arm of the ruling Golden Order.
2025/01/17 19:27:50 EST - Are kind of, like, noticeably absent on the streets right now. There's something going on their attention is elsewhere.
2025/01/17 19:27:57 EST - And looking at my passive perception here.
2025/01/17 19:28:05 EST - Actually, anyone that wants to can give me a perception check.
2025/01/17 19:28:09 EST - Could I feel somebody? Yes.
2025/01/17 19:28:18 EST - I can't believe I forgot. No worries. I got you covered. Can I do a perception? Check absolutely anyone that wants to.
2025/01/17 19:28:23 EST - Let me know if you got above a 14.
2025/01/17 19:28:25 EST - No. 13.
2025/01/17 19:28:28 EST - Twelve.
2025/01/17 19:28:31 EST - Nails. Probably getting to me.
2025/01/17 19:28:36 EST - Or I should say, 14 or above.
2025/01/17 19:28:42 EST - Yeah.
2025/01/17 19:28:50 EST - Okay.
2025/01/17 19:28:52 EST - Great.
2025/01/17 19:28:55 EST - But not.
2025/01/17 19:28:56 EST - No worries.
2025/01/17 19:29:00 EST - The door bursts open.
2025/01/17 19:29:04 EST - And.
2025/01/17 19:29:12 EST - Bit disheveled because she's clearly been, like, running out of breath.
2025/01/17 19:29:18 EST - Robed gift basket in hand.
2025/01/17 19:29:25 EST - Some sort of official looking personage bursts into the tavern.
2025/01/17 19:29:34 EST - And you see.
2025/01/17 19:29:43 EST - She has a frantic look around the tavern, and she sees your table and seems immediately, like, relieved. To see such a group of capable.
2025/01/17 19:29:46 EST - Clearly adventurous.
2025/01/17 19:29:50 EST - I mean, multiple quarter stabs, hammers, battle axes.
2025/01/17 19:29:56 EST - You tend to announce yourselves in a group.
2025/01/17 19:30:00 EST - She saunters over to the table and she announced, introduces herself.
2025/01/17 19:30:02 EST - Hi.
2025/01/17 19:30:05 EST - I'm Garland Willemain.
2025/01/17 19:30:11 EST - I'm high arts keeper here for the city in case. In case you don't. Know me.
2025/01/17 19:30:14 EST - I need some help.
2025/01/17 19:30:19 EST - The Golden Knights are. They typically accompany me on things like this.
2025/01/17 19:30:23 EST - There's something imminently happening.
2025/01/17 19:30:28 EST - We're having a guest come to an archway unexpectedly.
2025/01/17 19:30:35 EST - My job is to make sure that they are welcomed, just as you were.
2025/01/17 19:30:37 EST - But.
2025/01/17 19:30:38 EST - Sometimes.
2025/01/17 19:30:40 EST - Occasionally things go a little sideways.
2025/01/17 19:30:41 EST - And so.
2025/01/17 19:30:45 EST - I would like some insurance.
2025/01/17 19:30:48 EST - You look like a very capable, capable group.
2025/01/17 19:30:52 EST - I'm sorry I have to almost demand this of you.
2025/01/17 19:30:57 EST - I have no more time. Will you help?
2025/01/17 19:31:04 EST - She'll just start quietly, just, like, shoves back her seat and picks up her stuff. And just like.
2025/01/17 19:31:06 EST - Are we going? Nice.
2025/01/17 19:31:10 EST - Is there a chance of fighting?
2025/01/17 19:31:15 EST - Like I said, I have horror, violence of all kinds. My job.
2025/01/17 19:31:16 EST - Is to welcome.
2025/01/17 19:31:20 EST - Look at seven Jing.
2025/01/17 19:31:24 EST - And Ethan, but yet.
2025/01/17 19:31:29 EST - In a life reborn as a culinary genius. So for all of us.
2025/01/17 19:31:32 EST - There's grace, just in case.
2025/01/17 19:31:35 EST - Just in case.
2025/01/17 19:31:40 EST - Wonderful. Just shoved by.
2025/01/17 19:31:44 EST - All right.
2025/01/17 19:31:47 EST - That sounds like fun, doesn't it? Wonderful.
2025/01/17 19:31:49 EST - An archway.
2025/01/17 19:31:56 EST - In the central marketplace is about to activate. We have ways of detecting this most of the time.
2025/01/17 19:32:00 EST - And we need to make our way.
2025/01/17 19:32:02 EST - Their postaste.
2025/01/17 19:32:09 EST - Yeah, I think I've covered all the bases.
2025/01/17 19:32:15 EST - Let's go. And she plops down.
2025/01/17 19:32:20 EST - Three or four gold pieces under the table, and she says, I'll fear tab.
2025/01/17 19:32:23 EST - And savage says, oh, that'll do nicely.
2025/01/17 19:32:34 EST - You all banana. Obviously better confused asks if post taste means he's going to be carrying. Male.
2025/01/17 19:32:37 EST - We'll get into that.
2025/01/17 19:32:38 EST - Yes.
2025/01/17 19:32:59 EST - You rise from the table. Go ahead. Say Laura stacks everything on her plate, taking, like, a little bit extra while everybody's standing up and she's, like, stacking her fork and. Knife and stuff and cleaning up all her stuff. Nice.
2025/01/17 19:33:01 EST - It's very polite.
2025/01/17 19:33:02 EST - Extremely polite.
2025/01/17 19:33:08 EST - As Archnele set and two quarters to have knock all of that over onto.
2025/01/17 19:33:13 EST - The best leg plan.
2025/01/17 19:33:15 EST - You try so hard.
2025/01/17 19:33:19 EST - So.
2025/01/17 19:33:23 EST - I'll give you another opportunity to make, at this point, a perception check.
2025/01/17 19:33:33 EST - As we are leaving, Elsman is going to take his ail and pour it into a flat. Because if it were a superior healing potion. Okay, excellent.
2025/01/17 19:33:37 EST - Only slightly better.
2025/01/17 19:33:40 EST - Come up to six.
2025/01/17 19:33:47 EST - 1917 as well. Excellent, Mr. Suit Bananorf and.
2025/01/17 19:33:48 EST - Shale.
2025/01/17 19:33:52 EST - Each of you clearly clock.
2025/01/17 19:34:02 EST - There was a shady character. Best way to describe them. Classic Shady cloaked character in a corner.
2025/01/17 19:34:04 EST - Who?
2025/01/17 19:34:08 EST - Mix a hurried exit out the door as you rise from the table.
2025/01/17 19:34:19 EST - But.
2025/01/17 19:34:21 EST - You leave the tavern?
2025/01/17 19:34:23 EST - And.
2025/01/17 19:34:25 EST - You follow garland?
2025/01/17 19:34:29 EST - You make your way.
2025/01/17 19:34:30 EST - Through.
2025/01/17 19:34:34 EST - The streets of the city.
2025/01/17 19:34:38 EST - At one point.
2025/01/17 19:34:40 EST - You're stopped, I think.
2025/01/17 19:34:42 EST - You're.
2025/01/17 19:34:43 EST - Stopped by.
2025/01/17 19:34:45 EST - You can see.
2025/01/17 19:34:47 EST - People are.
2025/01/17 19:34:50 EST - Pulling drapes.
2025/01/17 19:34:53 EST - It is now evening. Shops are closing down.
2025/01/17 19:34:56 EST - Folks are closing up for the night. They're locking up.
2025/01/17 19:34:58 EST - And now.
2025/01/17 19:35:00 EST - A small party of.
2025/01/17 19:35:02 EST - Three shop owners.
2025/01/17 19:35:12 EST - See a rather large and honestly somewhat intimidating looking party marching down the street. There are no golden nights around.
2025/01/17 19:35:14 EST - And so.
2025/01/17 19:35:18 EST - They freeze an alarm and say,
2025/01/17 19:35:20 EST - Stop.
2025/01/17 19:35:23 EST - We don't want any trouble.
2025/01/17 19:35:25 EST - Don't rob us.
2025/01/17 19:35:29 EST - We're just following.
2025/01/17 19:35:31 EST - Garland.
2025/01/17 19:35:35 EST - Garland says.
2025/01/17 19:35:40 EST - It's good to have backup.
2025/01/17 19:35:44 EST - I'm Garland. Garland. Garland Willemain.
2025/01/17 19:35:47 EST - High archkeeper.
2025/01/17 19:35:49 EST - We really do need to get through.
2025/01/17 19:35:51 EST - So I'm just.
2025/01/17 19:36:01 EST - Don't mind this party. One of the shopkeepers says, hey, yeah, I don't. Like the looks of this either. Frankly, I'd never heard of you, Garland.
2025/01/17 19:36:08 EST - And I'm going to have to ask you to state your business, and you can see that he's reaching behind the door for something.
2025/01/17 19:36:13 EST - Shale having spomped out kind of the front.
2025/01/17 19:36:19 EST - Just sort of looks up at him and is like, or you can go back inside. Okay.
2025/01/17 19:36:21 EST - Give me intimidation.
2025/01/17 19:36:33 EST - That's the natural. Natural. 20 for 24. Wow.
2025/01/17 19:36:41 EST - You've never seen blood drain from a face as quickly as it does this gentleman.
2025/01/17 19:36:49 EST - You see. With another word he backs away, goes behind the door. Small, wet, stained.
2025/01/17 19:36:51 EST - Behind himself.
2025/01/17 19:36:56 EST - And with that, the tension kind of, kind of fades. You see, others begin to follow suit.
2025/01/17 19:36:59 EST - As you wear.
2025/01/17 19:37:01 EST - Have a pleasant evening.
2025/01/17 19:37:08 EST - If they want to donate to our call, do our research.
2025/01/17 19:37:17 EST - You see?
2025/01/17 19:37:21 EST - You see the archway?
2025/01/17 19:37:26 EST - Before you even approach the market square proper.
2025/01/17 19:37:31 EST - It's this towering structure, perhaps 30ft tall.
2025/01/17 19:37:36 EST - Stone carved with.
2025/01/17 19:37:42 EST - Intricate runes. Looks. It's just an archway. It's not attached to any building.
2025/01/17 19:37:47 EST - In fact, the buildings are all of different stone.
2025/01/17 19:37:50 EST - It has no earthly purpose being there.
2025/01/17 19:37:52 EST - But they built a market around it.
2025/01/17 19:37:55 EST - As you do.
2025/01/17 19:37:56 EST - And.
2025/01/17 19:37:58 EST - As you approach.
2025/01/17 19:38:01 EST - The archway.
2025/01/17 19:38:10 EST - Garland kind of ready is the gift, gift basket and says, remember, we welcome all who come through. The arches.
2025/01/17 19:38:14 EST - Just give me a little space, but be ready.
2025/01/17 19:38:15 EST - Just in case.
2025/01/17 19:38:18 EST - Okay.
2025/01/17 19:38:20 EST - As you approach.
2025/01/17 19:38:23 EST - Like you timed it perfectly.
2025/01/17 19:38:29 EST - Can I make a perception check first? Sure. Yeah. What? What are you trying to perceive?
2025/01/17 19:38:32 EST - Just like everything around, okay?
2025/01/17 19:38:38 EST - 22, I think. Amazing. Yeah. You see the market?
2025/01/17 19:38:40 EST - Is.
2025/01/17 19:38:46 EST - Ordinarily bustling with people. It's all quieting down.
2025/01/17 19:38:48 EST - There's still people.
2025/01/17 19:38:50 EST - About, but.
2025/01/17 19:38:51 EST - This is not a busy time.
2025/01/17 19:38:54 EST - In the market. Some people are strolling.
2025/01/17 19:38:57 EST - You get folks of all types.
2025/01/17 19:38:59 EST - All species.
2025/01/17 19:39:07 EST - Some folks. Some folks clearly work here. Some folks look bored. Some folks. Some folks look like.
2025/01/17 19:39:09 EST - They're looking for something.
2025/01/17 19:39:13 EST - You see?
2025/01/17 19:39:15 EST - A teenage couple hand in hand.
2025/01/17 19:39:17 EST - Walking down.
2025/01/17 19:39:19 EST - The upper stroll.
2025/01/17 19:39:26 EST - You clearly see the archway beginning to arc?
2025/01/17 19:39:30 EST - And kind of sparkle as these runes come to life.
2025/01/17 19:39:33 EST - And kind of shimmering field begins to.
2025/01/17 19:39:35 EST - Fill the archway.
2025/01/17 19:39:41 EST - And.
2025/01/17 19:39:43 EST - The moment.
2025/01/17 19:39:49 EST - That the field sort of. Sort of completes and meets in the middle outfly.
2025/01/17 19:39:55 EST - They look for all the world like cat sized mosquitoes.
2025/01/17 19:39:56 EST - Wow.
2025/01/17 19:40:01 EST - And I need everyone to please roll initiatives.
2025/01/17 19:40:03 EST - Actually.
2025/01/17 19:40:07 EST - I say that for a fact? We're going to go around the table.
2025/01/17 19:40:10 EST - Force a habit.
2025/01/17 19:40:14 EST - Yeah.
2025/01/17 19:40:16 EST - Right beforehand.
2025/01/17 19:40:17 EST - The nanor.
2025/01/17 19:40:18 EST - Says.
2025/01/17 19:40:22 EST - Dr. Big mosquito.
2025/01/17 19:40:30 EST - You hear cries?
2025/01/17 19:40:33 EST - Of confusion and surprise.
2025/01/17 19:40:36 EST - And then one of them clearly attacks.
2025/01/17 19:40:39 EST - One of the townsfolk.
2025/01/17 19:40:42 EST - And someone else goes sturges.
2025/01/17 19:40:50 EST - So at Mr. Suit, you are first. I'm going to have you guys.
2025/01/17 19:40:56 EST - Please take your turn.
2025/01/17 19:41:00 EST - When.
2025/01/17 19:41:02 EST - The time comes.
2025/01/17 19:41:08 EST - For the surges to attack. I'm actually going to have you guys roll to hit. And damage for me.
2025/01/17 19:41:11 EST - We're going to mix it up a little bit.
2025/01/17 19:41:15 EST - You see?
2025/01/17 19:41:20 EST - A mass 13, 1516 hard to count sturges.
2025/01/17 19:41:24 EST - A swarm fly out and begin kind of indiscriminately.
2025/01/17 19:41:28 EST - Attacking people. There is one headed directly at you.
2025/01/17 19:41:34 EST - So, ed bard.
2025/01/17 19:41:37 EST - Is going to pull up. Sync me.
2025/01/17 19:41:42 EST - And then just casually throw his hand out.
2025/01/17 19:41:43 EST - And.
2025/01/17 19:41:45 EST - A lengthy bolt.
2025/01/17 19:41:48 EST - Of this purplish.
2025/01/17 19:41:50 EST - Heck, yeah.
2025/01/17 19:41:53 EST - It looks almost like just.
2025/01/17 19:41:59 EST - A solid band of color just flies straight from it towards one of the sturges.
2025/01/17 19:42:07 EST - That is a 17. Yes. Sturgeon's armor classoids is 13, by the way.
2025/01/17 19:42:09 EST - 13 is what you need to hit.
2025/01/17 19:42:19 EST - And it is ten point to four standard. Oh, yeah. So you watch as this, like, purple bolt. Just like. It's like it evaporates.
2025/01/17 19:42:21 EST - It's gone.
2025/01/17 19:42:25 EST - Well, it does work very well. Isn't it fantastic?
2025/01/17 19:42:27 EST - Nino.
2025/01/17 19:42:34 EST - And then.
2025/01/17 19:42:37 EST - Arvin is next, and then.
2025/01/17 19:42:42 EST - Dark. Shauna will be on that. Do I need it?
2025/01/17 19:42:53 EST - Gonna be on the back here, right?
2025/01/17 19:42:59 EST - There. I'm going to come back to you in just a second, Nina.
2025/01/17 19:43:06 EST - So Arwin swings his long sword at the closest one to him.
2025/01/17 19:43:17 EST - 13 to hit and does eleven damage. Amazing. You slice it cleanly in half and you see. Two mosquito halves. Funk, funk fall falls, fall to the ground amazing, Darshana.
2025/01/17 19:43:25 EST - We'll try a sacred slame on one of the ones that is attacking a town. Person. Never mind the one attacking capable adventurers, okay?
2025/01/17 19:43:28 EST - Fail.
2025/01/17 19:43:33 EST - How much damage does sacred flying do?
2025/01/17 19:43:42 EST - Does a v eight always fail to save? You mean? Yes, I fail to save. Yeah. Okay, seven. Pointed ammo. Amazing. Yeah. So you watch as this.
2025/01/17 19:43:49 EST - Sturge giant mosquito thing like, bursts into flame from the inside out, which is kind of a neat thing to watch, actually.
2025/01/17 19:43:53 EST - With some invocation language that you're pretty sure is not a real language.
2025/01/17 19:43:58 EST - Cool. I like that flavor.
2025/01/17 19:44:06 EST - So at this point, we're about halfway down the order. Half the surges are going. To go. Oh, sorry. Nina. Circle back to you, yes.
2025/01/17 19:44:10 EST - Can I craft thundercraft, which is.

2025/01/17 19:45:13 EST - Half of the sturges attack.
2025/01/17 19:45:15 EST - Not you, mr. Soup.
2025/01/17 19:45:19 EST - But I keep forgetting your character's name. Give me just a second.
2025/01/17 19:45:24 EST - Philora. Yes, Phyllora and Arwin.
2025/01/17 19:45:27 EST - And Darshana.
2025/01/17 19:45:31 EST - Could you all please roll to hit against yourself with a plus five bonus?
2025/01/17 19:45:35 EST - And if you fail, you take three points of damage.
2025/01/17 19:45:39 EST - Or if. If they hit you, take three points of damage.

2025/01/17 19:45:57 EST - Roll the 20. Okay, so as a Miss Darshana, the sturge, it's got. This mosquito like Proboscis nose.
2025/01/17 19:46:02 EST - Comes right to your shoulder, kind of lodges itself in there. You take three points of damage and.
2025/01/17 19:46:06 EST - It's like sucking your blood a little bit.
2025/01/17 19:46:09 EST - It is attached.
2025/01/17 19:46:12 EST - It does indeed.
2025/01/17 19:46:18 EST - Fantastic. And we will go.
2025/01/17 19:46:20 EST - To.
2025/01/17 19:46:24 EST - Playing.

2025/01/17 19:46:33 EST - Yeah.
2025/01/17 19:46:38 EST - They're fast, they're flying around, but you can absolutely move to hit one.
2025/01/17 19:46:42 EST - Okay, I'm going to go for one with.
2025/01/17 19:46:45 EST - My warhammer, okay?

2025/01/17 19:49:46 EST - Is there a sturge coming for me? Yes, there's a storage coming for each of you.
2025/01/17 19:49:49 EST - I would like to make a scimitar attack against it. Okay?
2025/01/17 19:49:55 EST - 513. Yes, that is.
2025/01/17 19:50:05 EST - One point a clutching in there. Okay, a grazing blow, but it is injured.
2025/01/17 19:50:09 EST - And I live and go to bananas.
2025/01/17 19:50:15 EST - Jess, you don't have a modifier to your with.
2025/01/17 19:50:19 EST - Damage sacred flying.
2025/01/17 19:50:25 EST - Trying to remember. What? The order hasn't done this in a while.
2025/01/17 19:50:28 EST - It's a safety.
2025/01/17 19:50:29 EST - Yeah.
2025/01/17 19:50:32 EST - So I have that one moment.
2025/01/17 19:50:33 EST - It passes.
2025/01/17 19:50:35 EST - All right.
2025/01/17 19:50:37 EST - So does it come down near it?
2025/01/17 19:50:44 EST - Yeah. Just describe to me what a sacred flame that doesn't quite hit its target.
2025/01/17 19:50:48 EST - Wizard finger.
2025/01/17 19:50:53 EST - Righteous.
2025/01/17 19:50:59 EST - The remainder of the sturges attack. You see three of them go for civilians.
2025/01/17 19:51:03 EST - There are currently three civilians.
2025/01/17 19:51:06 EST - That.
2025/01/17 19:51:07 EST - Are.
2025/01/17 19:51:10 EST - Not looking good.
2025/01/17 19:51:12 EST - They have these.
2025/01/17 19:51:20 EST - Storages stuck into them. One of them looks like he's already unconscious. Two of them. Are actually kind of pretty near the arch.
2025/01/17 19:51:21 EST - And then.
2025/01/17 19:51:23 EST - Let me.
2025/01/17 19:51:27 EST - Have.
2025/01/17 19:51:30 EST - Thanon and.
2025/01/17 19:51:32 EST - Bananorf.
2025/01/17 19:51:36 EST - And.
2025/01/17 19:51:38 EST - Arwin.
2025/01/17 19:51:43 EST - Rule to hit against yourself plus five.
2025/01/17 19:51:48 EST - Where are you hitting yourself?
2025/01/17 19:51:57 EST - No, you did not. So whatever that is, plus five doesn't beat your AC.
2025/01/17 19:51:58 EST - Yes.
2025/01/17 19:52:08 EST - It does. Okay, then you take three points of damage and you have a sturge stuck in. You? I was checking rules. Is it too late to make a reaction on that? No.
2025/01/17 19:52:14 EST - I have protection, fighting style. Fantastic. Which means that the reaction I can impose disadvantage on the attack.
2025/01/17 19:52:16 EST - Go ahead and reroll.
2025/01/17 19:52:20 EST - Great call. That's why you have to be next. That is most excellent.
2025/01/17 19:52:26 EST - Eight. Okay, that's a miss plus five. Yeah, 13, which is 13.
2025/01/17 19:52:28 EST - Yeah.
2025/01/17 19:52:32 EST - Fantastic. You can take inspiration.
2025/01/17 19:52:35 EST - I got hit.
2025/01/17 19:52:37 EST - Okay.
2025/01/17 19:52:39 EST - A natural 20.
2025/01/17 19:52:41 EST - Okay.
2025/01/17 19:52:45 EST - I think that.
2025/01/17 19:52:51 EST - Kind of gets under the headband it gets under.
2025/01/17 19:53:00 EST - The headband and kind of in the ear and, boy, it doesn't feel like that. That would be very effective, but, man, it's smarts. And you take six points of damage.
2025/01/17 19:53:08 EST - I also got hit. You also got hit? Three points of damage. Mosquito, kind of.
2025/01/17 19:53:12 EST - In the gap in your armor.
2025/01/17 19:53:17 EST - And that takes us to.
2025/01/17 19:53:19 EST - The next round.
2025/01/17 19:53:22 EST - And I will say,
2025/01/17 19:53:24 EST - At this point.
2025/01/17 19:53:27 EST - Let me get folks to make.
2025/01/17 19:53:33 EST - Actually. One moment, Orin Philora.
2025/01/17 19:53:39 EST - Eldman and Bannorf. Give me a perception check.
2025/01/17 19:53:51 EST - 1313. Can I use.
2025/01/17 19:53:55 EST - Since I am lucky. Yeah, you can use luck. One. All right.
2025/01/17 19:53:57 EST - Eyeball again.
2025/01/17 19:54:00 EST - 1818. Amazing.
2025/01/17 19:54:03 EST - Yeah.
2025/01/17 19:54:08 EST - So you absolutely clock bananarf?
2025/01/17 19:54:22 EST - I don't know if you saw them, but you probably somebody mentioned they saw someone leave. Leave the tavern, you see the same shady cloaked person.
2025/01/17 19:54:28 EST - Running full tilt toward Garland.
2025/01/17 19:54:36 EST - Garland. By the way, I forgot about Garland also has a sturge sort of stuck. Stuck in. Her side she's dealing with.
2025/01/17 19:54:40 EST - And that takes us. That takes us.
2025/01/17 19:54:44 EST - To the top of the round and back to Mr. Stood.
2025/01/17 19:54:45 EST - All right.
2025/01/17 19:54:50 EST - So Mr. Soot is going to.
2025/01/17 19:54:54 EST - Try that again. Yes, I should say so.
2025/01/17 19:54:57 EST - And it worked last time. It worked last time.
2025/01/17 19:54:58 EST - So.
2025/01/17 19:55:06 EST - He's kind of like covering his eyes a little bit, shaving it there and pointing. Out toward the.
2025/01/17 19:55:08 EST - Wouldn't be bad to have.
2025/01/17 19:55:10 EST - A friend.
2025/01/17 19:55:13 EST - In the arch masters.
2025/01/17 19:55:16 EST - And so going.
2025/01/17 19:55:23 EST - To point that. Excellent. The one that is stuck in the garland. I like it where your head's. At.
2025/01/17 19:55:27 EST - That is 19. One to do. That'll do it.
2025/01/17 19:55:32 EST - Eight points. Okay, yeah.
2025/01/17 19:55:45 EST - There's something about. There's something about the way it explodes and the fact that the nose was, like, stuck.
2025/01/17 19:55:48 EST - And garland goes,
2025/01/17 19:55:52 EST - Oh, that's not going to endear me.
2025/01/17 19:56:00 EST - But yes, quite dead. Very much dead.
2025/01/17 19:56:03 EST - And felara.
2025/01/17 19:56:05 EST - And then.
2025/01/17 19:56:07 EST - Our one is up on deck.
2025/01/17 19:56:11 EST - Okay. All right.
2025/01/17 19:56:16 EST - I'm going to cast thorn wit. Yes.
2025/01/17 19:56:21 EST - I think there's still one attacking. That's a two hit. Yeah.
2025/01/17 19:56:23 EST - Kendrick.
2025/01/17 19:56:29 EST - 20. Natural 20. No, not dirty 20. You hit? Yeah.
2025/01/17 19:56:33 EST - Pro tip roll your damage dice at the same time you roll.
2025/01/17 19:56:35 EST - Your 20.
2025/01/17 19:56:42 EST - Seven. Amazing.
2025/01/17 19:56:45 EST - What does the thorn whip look like?
2025/01/17 19:56:49 EST - It's like this whip do you hold at the gym?
2025/01/17 19:56:51 EST - That has thorns around it.
2025/01/17 19:56:53 EST - Nice.
2025/01/17 19:56:57 EST - Yeah, so you watch.
2025/01/17 19:57:01 EST - Obliterates it. Nice one.
2025/01/17 19:57:06 EST - Arwyn, wait. As a bonus action, can I capture you? Sure can.
2025/01/17 19:57:09 EST - You summon a shale.
2025/01/17 19:57:13 EST - So that's a 23 to hit.
2025/01/17 19:57:18 EST - Oh, wait. You could only attack what said.
2025/01/17 19:57:21 EST - Shalay is a spouse.
2025/01/17 19:57:23 EST - It's a leveled spell. No.
2025/01/17 19:57:27 EST - It's an antenna. Okay, so you can't do that because.
2025/01/17 19:57:33 EST - You just did your thermal that you can do that in the beginning of your next round. Yeah.
2025/01/17 19:57:39 EST - Okay, so 23 to hit with the long sword. Yeah. Is he close enough?
2025/01/17 19:57:41 EST - To.
2025/01/17 19:57:44 EST - Any of the civilians that are being attacked.
2025/01/17 19:57:53 EST - Within 30ft to run. Yeah. There's currently three civies that are kind of down. Two are near the arch.
2025/01/17 19:57:59 EST - Thank you. Kind of near shell.
2025/01/17 19:58:01 EST - And there's one that's a bit further away.
2025/01/17 19:58:15 EST - Kind of. Kind of toward the edge of where the market is. So I would pick one of the civilians that's being attacked. Which one is within 30 people? Which one? Well, it's. The one that by itself.
2025/01/17 19:58:19 EST - Is within 30ft, then I'll go for that one. Yeah, you can do that.
2025/01/17 19:58:25 EST - And so 23 to hit and ten points of damage. Okay, you obliterate that, Sturge.
2025/01/17 19:58:27 EST - Great work.
2025/01/17 19:58:31 EST - And that'll take us to Darshana.
2025/01/17 19:58:35 EST - I want to target one of the stirredies and on one of the civilians. It's kind of about a gate.
2025/01/17 19:58:42 EST - I'm wondering, is it going to be stuff fair? Like, if I do a faker? Claim without damaging the person as well.
2025/01/17 19:58:45 EST - That just hitting the surge.
2025/01/17 19:58:48 EST - Give me an inside check.
2025/01/17 19:58:51 EST - 19. Okay.
2025/01/17 19:59:02 EST - You clearly saw what happened with Mr. Sutton, Garland. You managed to clock that, and I'd. Say at this point, your best bet is they are likely to take some damage.
2025/01/17 19:59:17 EST - So in that case, I will go to the civilian. Am I able to just make a strike? Check to physically pull the surface. Yeah, I'm not even making a roll for it. You can just yank it out. I will do that, and then I will make meaningful eye contact with. The dragon Ball.
2025/01/17 19:59:29 EST - I'll remind you that you're choosing not to do the same to the one that's currently attached to yourself. That is right, and I'm well aware of that. All right, cool. Yes. To the dragonborn. And say, here, this is for you.
2025/01/17 19:59:32 EST - Fantastic.
2025/01/17 19:59:35 EST - That was the one attached.
2025/01/17 19:59:39 EST - To whom again? Gatesville. If I passed to one of the civilians that.
2025/01/17 19:59:45 EST - Requires you to get close to the gate.
2025/01/17 19:59:47 EST - And.
2025/01/17 19:59:50 EST - One of the kind of arcane.
2025/01/17 19:59:54 EST - Coronations, sparkles.
2025/01/17 19:59:58 EST - Kind of launches itself towards you. I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.
2025/01/17 20:00:02 EST - How about seven?
2025/01/17 20:00:07 EST - You, unfortunately, take two points of force damage, all right?
2025/01/17 20:00:17 EST - There's, like, a one time hit, or is that, like, in a damaging field of energy? You probably don't want to stick around, like, right there.
2025/01/17 20:00:20 EST - But that is a one time hit.
2025/01/17 20:00:26 EST - And that takes us to the sturges.
2025/01/17 20:00:36 EST - Because you also have the sturge embedded in you still.
2025/01/17 20:00:44 EST - Is sucking your will to live. It is sucking on your life, your life essence.
2025/01/17 20:00:46 EST - You lose three hit points.
2025/01/17 20:00:50 EST - And must succeed in the DC twelve consave.
2025/01/17 20:00:59 EST - I did not succeed on a DC twelve. All right, you have four. You have the poison condition.
2025/01/17 20:01:00 EST - Nice.
2025/01/17 20:01:02 EST - All right.
2025/01/17 20:01:10 EST - Oh, my God, guys, I just realized we're the fruit basket.
2025/01/17 20:01:15 EST - Please take. Please take inspiration.
2025/01/17 20:01:25 EST - A basketball is inspiration for you.
2025/01/17 20:01:30 EST - All right. I also have a sturge attached to me. Yes.
2025/01/17 20:01:35 EST - I passed my consequence. Okay, so you take three points of damage.
2025/01/17 20:01:41 EST - You are not poisoned. Anyone else have us have a storage attached to them currently?
2025/01/17 20:01:43 EST - Yes. Okay.
2025/01/17 20:01:48 EST - They got a 16.
2025/01/17 20:01:51 EST - So, the student hubs? Yeah.
2025/01/17 20:01:55 EST - So.
2025/01/17 20:01:57 EST - You got 16 on your save.
2025/01/17 20:01:59 EST - No.
2025/01/17 20:02:03 EST - I do a save. Yeah, so they don't need to hit if they're already. In you.
2025/01/17 20:02:07 EST - They suck. Your life essence. You take three points of damage. But I do need to save.
2025/01/17 20:02:11 EST - Save.
2025/01/17 20:02:14 EST - That's what you say, but I rolled a 16.
2025/01/17 20:02:18 EST - This time I rolled a 19. Okay, awesome.
2025/01/17 20:02:22 EST - You are not poisoned. You're not poisoned.
2025/01/17 20:02:25 EST - And let me get.
2025/01/17 20:02:28 EST - To a to hit roll from Mr. Soot.
2025/01/17 20:02:30 EST - And from.
2025/01/17 20:02:32 EST - Shale and from.
2025/01/17 20:02:36 EST - Eldman.
2025/01/17 20:02:41 EST - Never one natural one that's going to do it.
2025/01/17 20:02:44 EST - Miss city.
2025/01/17 20:02:52 EST - Hip on Edwin. I hit on advert. You take three points of damage and you have a. Sturge stuck. All right.
2025/01/17 20:02:53 EST - Yeah.
2025/01/17 20:02:58 EST - Okay, so three points of damage. No, that has no tip.
2025/01/17 20:03:01 EST - It looks completely flat from here.
2025/01/17 20:03:06 EST - Three points of damage and you have a sturge stuck in E. Wait.
2025/01/17 20:03:10 EST - It does not hit. Fantastic. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Thank you.
2025/01/17 20:03:12 EST - Medic.
2025/01/17 20:03:14 EST - I'm busy.
2025/01/17 20:03:19 EST - The cultist.
2025/01/17 20:03:21 EST - The shady character.
2025/01/17 20:03:25 EST - Runs up and stabs Garland.
2025/01/17 20:03:29 EST - And.
2025/01/17 20:03:30 EST - She drops the basket.
2025/01/17 20:03:34 EST - She is.
2025/01/17 20:03:37 EST - Dealing with that.
2025/01/17 20:03:43 EST - I'll leave it to you to decide what to do with it with that detail and. We'll pick up.
2025/01/17 20:03:45 EST - With.
2025/01/17 20:03:47 EST - Fan.
2025/01/17 20:03:54 EST - Fanon hits with a set for one or hit at the one in his ear. Okay.
2025/01/17 20:03:58 EST - Do you want to remove it first, or do you want us want to hit it?
2025/01/17 20:04:03 EST - I'm trying to hit it out violently, okay?
2025/01/17 20:04:06 EST - I'm going to make it. Shit. I'm going to make you choose.
2025/01/17 20:04:10 EST - You can remove it or you can hit it.
2025/01/17 20:04:18 EST - I'll try to remember. No, I'm going to just try to hit it all. Right? Yeah, absolutely. You can roll with it. Yeah, you can roll with advantage.
2025/01/17 20:04:23 EST - I get a.
2025/01/17 20:04:26 EST - 23 yes, absolutely.
2025/01/17 20:04:28 EST - Roll damage.
2025/01/17 20:04:33 EST - Four damage, okay?
2025/01/17 20:04:35 EST - That is enough.
2025/01/17 20:04:41 EST - You squash the mosquito, but also wring your own ear at the same time and take two. Damage.
2025/01/17 20:04:47 EST - And that brings us to Oren.
2025/01/17 20:04:51 EST - I flash with anger.
2025/01/17 20:04:53 EST - That she missed on her first.
2025/01/17 20:04:55 EST - Yeah.
2025/01/17 20:04:59 EST - Declares that she is so much better than these creatures.
2025/01/17 20:05:01 EST - Nice.
2025/01/17 20:05:05 EST - Things are the one that was loved at her by the short.
2025/01/17 20:05:14 EST - Excellence, by the way. I'm also down now. Oh, okay. All right. And that's. A net money. Oh, my goodness.
2025/01/17 20:05:18 EST - Oh, my goodness. Okay, yeah. Roll some damage. Keep rolling.
2025/01/17 20:05:22 EST - Just bug cuts ever just bug guts?
2025/01/17 20:05:25 EST - That is 21.
2025/01/17 20:05:26 EST - Wow.
2025/01/17 20:05:39 EST - This is four hit points. So describe to me what 21 points of slashing damage with your brand spank and new barbarian and battle axe. Looks like in this moment.
2025/01/17 20:05:51 EST - It was, like, back down on the ground. Oh, yeah. So she did, like, picked it up, brought it up over her head.
2025/01/17 20:05:53 EST - Yeah.

2025/01/17 20:05:59 EST - With a scream of.
2025/01/17 20:06:00 EST - Yeah.
2025/01/17 20:06:03 EST - It's a pretty cut, too.
2025/01/17 20:06:07 EST - It's like, right down the middle, super clean.
2025/01/17 20:06:12 EST - Amazing.
2025/01/17 20:06:15 EST - And they'll take us to shale.
2025/01/17 20:06:17 EST - You have.

2025/01/17 20:16:22 EST - Yeah.
2025/01/17 20:16:24 EST - No problem.
2025/01/17 20:16:28 EST - Darshana, you are currently poisoned.
2025/01/17 20:16:35 EST - And so I need you to. You take three points of damage, and I need you to make a conseve with this advantage.

2025/01/17 20:18:17 EST - When the dice stops moving. If it's not cocked, it's good.
2025/01/17 20:18:21 EST - I didn't aim for the bad guy.
2025/01/17 20:18:30 EST - Really appreciate we're out of range of the arcs. The two of us are, but I still have dirt on me? Absolutely.
2025/01/17 20:18:34 EST - Okay. All right. Thank you. And that will bring us to.

2025/01/17 20:21:18 EST - Totally would appreciate help.
2025/01/17 20:21:21 EST - Stoically ignoring the sturgeon.
2025/01/17 20:21:25 EST - Throwing the sturge.

2025/01/17 20:22:09 EST - It is just my normal arms, right? It is.
2025/01/17 20:22:16 EST - It is a fastball pitch, and it is right on target. But the sturge gets to say, too, and it kind of went,
2025/01/17 20:22:20 EST - Flutters a little bit and it goes wide of the mark.
2025/01/17 20:22:26 EST - And I don't have any other bonus actions. Oh, no bonus action?

2025/01/17 20:23:48 EST - She is kind of not unconscious, but bleeding. Could use some help. There is a cultist who was badly injured.
2025/01/17 20:23:52 EST - There's at least two surgeries left in the air.
2025/01/17 20:23:59 EST - To intimidate the cultist again.
2025/01/17 20:24:03 EST - To get them to leave without having to build them. Yeah.

2025/01/17 20:26:07 EST - And.
2025/01/17 20:26:10 EST - You see the cultist?
2025/01/17 20:26:16 EST - Takes around, takes a look at you, clearly outnumbered, and.
2025/01/17 20:26:22 EST - Says you can't stop what's coming. She says, she says.
2025/01/17 20:26:28 EST - We await. We await the coming reign of the nameless king.
2025/01/17 20:26:31 EST - She says, hail Golgeron, and she runs.
2025/01/17 20:26:34 EST - Opportunity attack because I was within.
2025/01/17 20:26:36 EST - All that? Yeah.
2025/01/17 20:26:40 EST - Wait. You yelled a name while you called him nameless.
2025/01/17 20:26:48 EST - She says you'll see.
2025/01/17 20:26:52 EST - Like Schrodinger's name.

2025/01/17 20:27:04 EST - Yeah, the culpus is down.
2025/01/17 20:27:12 EST - She runs and I trip her with the back of my scimitar.
2025/01/17 20:27:13 EST - Amazing.
2025/01/17 20:27:20 EST - Nobody has a surge in them at the moment. Yes, I think I still do. Yeah, he's. Not man. Oh, that's correct.
2025/01/17 20:27:31 EST - Yeah. So, Darshan, you take three points of damage and you are still poisoned. I need you. To roll a concave with this advantage.
2025/01/17 20:27:34 EST - All right.
2025/01/17 20:27:41 EST - Three, okay?
2025/01/17 20:27:43 EST - You are now unconscious.
2025/01/17 20:27:47 EST - It's been a long day.
2025/01/17 20:27:52 EST - Your hit points remain where they are, but you have the unconscious condition.
2025/01/17 20:27:54 EST - Right.
2025/01/17 20:28:00 EST - And shale and philora.
2025/01/17 20:28:15 EST - Please roll to hit against your armor class with plus five. I mean, really, if you let the sturges eat more. It makes them a bigger target. 17. Okay, that's going to. Hit. So, Philara, you have a surge stuck in you. You take three points of damage.
2025/01/17 20:28:19 EST - And mr. Soot.
2025/01/17 20:28:21 EST - All right.
2025/01/17 20:28:25 EST - So there's definitely some blood trickling.
2025/01/17 20:28:29 EST - Than just, like, filming freezing on his skin there.
2025/01/17 20:28:33 EST - And not in good shape.
2025/01/17 20:28:36 EST - He is going to, though.
2025/01/17 20:28:42 EST - Try to target the. There's one remaining surge that did not. That's still flying. Right, because one.
2025/01/17 20:28:49 EST - There's a one you threw? Yes, the fastball special. Okay, it's probably within. 120ft. Yes, definitely.
2025/01/17 20:28:52 EST - Not quite that strong.
2025/01/17 20:28:57 EST - For the cat size. Another violet bean? Yes. Do it.
2025/01/17 20:29:03 EST - Let's see. 14. Yes, that'll do. All right.
2025/01/17 20:29:11 EST - And three points before staying. Okay, that one was previously hit, and so it is down. All right.
2025/01/17 20:29:15 EST - Fantastic. Lovely failura.
2025/01/17 20:29:20 EST - Can I kind of copy what Shailza did and except.
2025/01/17 20:29:24 EST - I don't just throw my or can try roll first.
2025/01/17 20:29:29 EST - If you want to take it out, it's going to take your action to pull it. Up.
2025/01/17 20:29:37 EST - So you don't need to roll it out. You absolutely can. You can pull it up. But if you have a bonus action or something else you'd like to do. Okay, all right.
2025/01/17 20:29:45 EST - So, Arwin, did you want to cast your shit on now? Okay. All right.
2025/01/17 20:29:49 EST - So she has one in her hand? Yes.
2025/01/17 20:29:51 EST - And.
2025/01/17 20:29:54 EST - Is there one still embedded? Yes.
2025/01/17 20:29:55 EST - Those are the final two.
2025/01/17 20:29:57 EST - Okay.
2025/01/17 20:30:05 EST - So.
2025/01/17 20:30:09 EST - If you want. If you want, like, fail arc and kind of, like, lob it and you. Can.
2025/01/17 20:30:14 EST - I will take a long sword swing. Yeah. Be like dog.
2025/01/17 20:30:18 EST - I promise not to miss.
2025/01/17 20:30:23 EST - No one's play. Laurie is a druid. She'd be like, duck wire. Yeah.
2025/01/17 20:30:30 EST - Is there? Armor clap. Okay.
2025/01/17 20:30:39 EST - And does eleven point 50. Okay. Yeah. So, yeah, it's a gentle lob and a. Right in half.
2025/01/17 20:30:40 EST - Excellent work.
2025/01/17 20:30:43 EST - And that takes us.
2025/01/17 20:30:45 EST - To.
2025/01/17 20:30:53 EST - The one storage left? Yes, just the one storage left. It is Darshana's turn. Darshana is unconscious, so we move on.
2025/01/17 20:30:57 EST - To. Actually, it's at this precise moment.
2025/01/17 20:31:00 EST - That the archway.
2025/01/17 20:31:02 EST - Crackles again.
2025/01/17 20:31:05 EST - And.
2025/01/17 20:31:07 EST - You see?
2025/01/17 20:31:12 EST - Stepping through the archway, looking for all the world.
2025/01/17 20:31:18 EST - Like a ball rog from Lord of the Rings. I can say it. They can't.
2025/01/17 20:31:22 EST - Like a ball rog from lord of the Rings.
2025/01/17 20:31:24 EST - A horned devil.
2025/01/17 20:31:28 EST - As Modius walked out of the portal.
2025/01/17 20:31:34 EST - I think our palace perfect condition for it, but.
2025/01/17 20:31:39 EST - Our parallel events. Actually, Mr. Soot, make.
2025/01/17 20:31:45 EST - Inside, Chuck. But our Palpins. This is clearly a fiend. Clearly. This is a fiend.
2025/01/17 20:31:51 EST - Tim. Straight up on the die, okay?
2025/01/17 20:31:55 EST - A ten out of ten.
2025/01/17 20:32:01 EST - There's a faint. The faintest flicker of brief recognition, and then it's gone.
2025/01/17 20:32:02 EST - Okay.
2025/01/17 20:32:04 EST - Bread.
2025/01/17 20:32:07 EST - Wait, what? Who?
2025/01/17 20:32:13 EST - And then the devil looks around.
2025/01/17 20:32:20 EST - Snarling it says, I am gold Koran.
2025/01/17 20:32:24 EST - Says thunderer of.
2025/01/17 20:32:29 EST - Thunderer.
2025/01/17 20:32:38 EST - It can't be that important because I forgot. Is this the guy? Who. The cultist. Worshipped. Yes.
2025/01/17 20:32:42 EST - They were very excited, clearly not aimless.
2025/01/17 20:32:53 EST - I can't remember the name of the place.
2025/01/17 20:33:01 EST - And you see he's looking around and there's this moment of total confusion on the verge of panic. He wields this gigantic.
2025/01/17 20:33:03 EST - Whipped.
2025/01/17 20:33:09 EST - Metal chain. It's just a chain with, like, barbs on it, and he's. Looking around.

2025/01/17 20:33:55 EST - Give me a. Just a sec.
2025/01/17 20:33:57 EST - Would definitely be a good barber.

2025/01/17 20:34:39 EST - Where's your masters?
2025/01/17 20:34:44 EST - That doesn't sound right.
2025/01/17 20:34:52 EST - And then, as excited and happy as Garland was a moment before, she's like, no.
2025/01/17 20:35:02 EST - All right.
2025/01/17 20:35:04 EST - Aaron.

2025/01/17 20:35:23 EST - I think. All right, well, we'll fill a little bit in a more intimidating way, so. Brandish her new act that she's so fond of now.
2025/01/17 20:35:25 EST - Yes. Welcome.
2025/01/17 20:35:32 EST - Nice. Okay. All right, so you're trying to intimidate him into feeling welcome.
2025/01/17 20:35:37 EST - Give me intimidation. Yes.
2025/01/17 20:35:40 EST - It's called peer pressure.
2025/01/17 20:35:44 EST - If you work poorly because you think you're cute, right?
2025/01/17 20:35:48 EST - A 16.

2025/01/17 20:36:09 EST - What do I do with it?
2025/01/17 20:36:11 EST - You need one.
2025/01/17 20:36:14 EST - You have a bath.
2025/01/17 20:36:17 EST - Is it big enough for me?
2025/01/17 20:36:24 EST - It's a huge, like, 300 by 300 foot pool.
2025/01/17 20:36:29 EST - Like, flaming or. He's not currently on fire.
2025/01/17 20:36:36 EST - Would he evaporate the bath?
2025/01/17 20:36:39 EST - We'll see.
2025/01/17 20:36:43 EST - Just kind of warm them up. Warm up?

2025/01/17 20:36:49 EST - Come with me. I will show you.
2025/01/17 20:36:51 EST - Mistress.
2025/01/17 20:36:58 EST - I haven't taken a bath in centuries.
2025/01/17 20:37:02 EST - Amazing.
2025/01/17 20:37:07 EST - Shale. Shale is in the middle of preparing a divine smite.

2025/01/17 20:37:31 EST - Dashana regains consciousness the moment.
2025/01/17 20:37:34 EST - You kind of pluck it out.
2025/01/17 20:37:36 EST - I had the craziest dream.
2025/01/17 20:37:40 EST - It did not suck.
2025/01/17 20:37:52 EST - Would it be a significant portion of my action economy to just lob it back towards the gate. Not at all. I would love back towards the gate. Hope it gets hit by lightning. Okay.
2025/01/17 20:37:57 EST - Yes, it does.
2025/01/17 20:38:01 EST - And I'll say,
2025/01/17 20:38:04 EST - Kind of scorps the scores on it. Yes, the Dutton's lawns weakness.
2025/01/17 20:38:13 EST - The gate as suddenly as it started. Kind of reverses, shimmers out until there's. Just a little spec in the middle.
2025/01/17 20:38:20 EST - Throwing them all through the gate, and we would have been done like, well, you can think of. It till Jesse.
2025/01/17 20:38:27 EST - Bullet pin and throw it back. Yeah.
2025/01/17 20:38:30 EST - Fantastic. Amazing.
2025/01/17 20:38:36 EST - I'm going to go stabilize the colts if I need to. If we need a question.
2025/01/17 20:38:38 EST - It's a great point.
2025/01/17 20:38:41 EST - Of me roll some dice here.
2025/01/17 20:38:48 EST - The commodores stabilized? That's a good question. I stabilize at least one, yes.
2025/01/17 20:38:50 EST - One commoner is dead.
2025/01/17 20:38:53 EST - But.
2025/01/17 20:38:54 EST - Two.
2025/01/17 20:38:57 EST - Are going to be just fine.

2025/01/17 20:39:28 EST - I don't care.
2025/01/17 20:39:31 EST - Dustin ruined.
2025/01/17 20:39:38 EST - You get the sense that these cultists and the knights don't get along real well?
2025/01/17 20:39:42 EST - Fantastic.
2025/01/17 20:39:48 EST - So you do kind of a citizen's arrest on this cultist.
2025/01/17 20:39:52 EST - Soon enough at Golden Knight.
2025/01/17 20:39:58 EST - Saunters by to take. To take them into custody. Actually, you meet them.
2025/01/17 20:40:04 EST - I think. Hold on.
2025/01/17 20:40:12 EST - I don't have the pc sheet.
2025/01/17 20:40:17 EST - It is a tall.
2025/01/17 20:40:18 EST - Tan.
2025/01/17 20:40:25 EST - Woman. She's the captain, actually. Bianca. Golden, gleaming, golden armor.
2025/01/17 20:40:30 EST - I mean, looks for all the world like a paladin should look.
2025/01/17 20:40:33 EST - And she says,
2025/01/17 20:40:39 EST - With an era of gratitude and comanche thanks. I will take it from here. Your service.
2025/01/17 20:40:41 EST - Has been noted.
2025/01/17 20:40:44 EST - She says, I am at a loss.
2025/01/17 20:40:56 EST - Well met Bianca, Bianca Swiftard. And she takes the cultist and as she does, and she kind of yanks the cul de sav off her feet.
2025/01/17 20:41:04 EST - The perceptive among you clock a small scrap of parchment flutter out of her robes into the floor.
2025/01/17 20:41:06 EST - And.
2025/01/17 20:41:12 EST - What would you say?
2025/01/17 20:41:16 EST - I didn't see it. Yeah.
2025/01/17 20:41:18 EST - All right.
2025/01/17 20:41:23 EST - I would say.
2025/01/17 20:41:28 EST - My folks with the higher passive perception clock. The note, if you'd like to check that. Out as well.
2025/01/17 20:41:31 EST - No, you didn't need a roll.
2025/01/17 20:41:35 EST - But you notice there's a little piece of parchment paper.
2025/01/17 20:41:36 EST - Yeah.
2025/01/17 20:41:39 EST - You check it out?
2025/01/17 20:41:44 EST - It's a cryptic note.
2025/01/17 20:41:50 EST - It's a cryptic note. It appears to be in some kind of a cipher.
2025/01/17 20:41:53 EST - Anyone.
2025/01/17 20:41:54 EST - Who?
2025/01/17 20:41:58 EST - Have, like, Capricorn languages.
2025/01/17 20:42:09 EST - Do you have? Comprehend languages? Yeah. That's a ritual? Yeah. Amazing you could cast comprehend languages. Or I would say if anyone has an intelligence based skill that they have proficiency in,
2025/01/17 20:42:13 EST - Okay. History.
2025/01/17 20:42:19 EST - Yeah. Rome, Arcana for 30 years.
2025/01/17 20:42:28 EST - That's 23. Amazing. I love that your barbarian has Arcana. That's fantastic.
2025/01/17 20:42:37 EST - I'm here for it. That's fantastic. Yeah, you have no problems. Just decide. Decide. It's a simple cipher.
2025/01/17 20:42:42 EST - Nonetheless, the words themselves don't make a ton of sense.
2025/01/17 20:42:43 EST - But.
2025/01/17 20:42:47 EST - You can mysteriously come back without the devil that don't say anything about it, right?
2025/01/17 20:42:55 EST - Yeah.
2025/01/17 20:42:58 EST - It's a scrap of paper that it describes.
2025/01/17 20:43:01 EST - The coming of.
2025/01/17 20:43:03 EST - Golgaron.
2025/01/17 20:43:05 EST - It is a devil.
2025/01/17 20:43:19 EST - The children of Abraxus is the name of the cult. The children of Abraxus. Ibra x us.
2025/01/17 20:43:24 EST - How many x's in the name for it to be good? Yes.
2025/01/17 20:43:31 EST - And the apostrophe. The apostrophe huge too.
2025/01/17 20:43:35 EST - Children of Abraxis believe that.
2025/01/17 20:43:41 EST - The coming of Goldiron will somehow aid their cause.
2025/01/17 20:43:43 EST - And you see.
2025/01/17 20:43:47 EST - Another mention of nameless king.
2025/01/17 20:43:50 EST - In the note.
2025/01/17 20:43:56 EST - Does religion eleven add any backstory to that religion eleven role? Yeah.
2025/01/17 20:44:01 EST - Actually give me history.
2025/01/17 20:44:06 EST - Also eleven. Okay. Yeah.
2025/01/17 20:44:09 EST - So.
2025/01/17 20:44:13 EST - You have been here. I don't know how long you've been in the city. Of arches, but you have been here long enough.
2025/01/17 20:44:17 EST - This is not a closely guarded secret.
2025/01/17 20:44:29 EST - It is currently the year 1141 Ar, which is after the reign of the nameless king. So there used to be some ruler. No one can remember their name.
2025/01/17 20:44:35 EST - But they influenced everything about the city.
2025/01/17 20:44:40 EST - The calendar used to be ar something, but we can't remember, right?
2025/01/17 20:44:42 EST - It was like.
2025/01/17 20:44:51 EST - It was. There was Br, and then who knows what that was about? And there's ar. Something. Whatever. It's 1141. Enjoy.
2025/01/17 20:44:55 EST - And then finally.
2025/01/17 20:44:59 EST - In the note.
2025/01/17 20:45:02 EST - Is a hastily scrawled map.
2025/01/17 20:45:04 EST - That.
2025/01/17 20:45:11 EST - Leads to appears to lead to a location in a place that you can recognize.
2025/01/17 20:45:13 EST - It is.
2025/01/17 20:45:16 EST - Above the goddess statues.
2025/01/17 20:45:22 EST - In the cliffs. In the cliffs. There's a lot of stuff that goes on in the cliffs.
2025/01/17 20:45:28 EST - There's apartments. Some people live there. There's certainly crypts and tombs.
2025/01/17 20:45:31 EST - When people die here in the city, they are taken. They are taken to.
2025/01/17 20:45:39 EST - Those tombs if they cannot afford a private. Private? Assumed there is a public. There's a. Public popper sum area.
2025/01/17 20:45:56 EST - But there's a segment that is set aside and is actually patrolled and access to it is controlled and it requires a special pass. Golden Knights that maintain 24 hours vigil at the doorway to the cliffs of the dead.
2025/01/17 20:46:00 EST - So this map clearly leads to the cliffs of the dead.
2025/01/17 20:46:06 EST - So you have that literally in your pocket.
2025/01/17 20:46:09 EST - I'd say.
2025/01/17 20:46:12 EST - Yeah, at this point.
2025/01/17 20:46:15 EST - Garland.
2025/01/17 20:46:17 EST - Is just ecstatic.
2025/01/17 20:46:20 EST - She's like, oh, that went sideways.
2025/01/17 20:46:27 EST - I am so glad. I'm so glad that I found you. Thank you. Thank you all. So much.
2025/01/17 20:46:31 EST - For your help and for remembering to welcome our guests.
2025/01/17 20:46:35 EST - I can't stress that enough. It's so important, she says.
2025/01/17 20:46:36 EST - In fact.
2025/01/17 20:46:43 EST - She looks directly at that on and she says, you seem like you might make a fine arch. Keeper.
2025/01/17 20:46:45 EST - We need to work on.
2025/01/17 20:46:47 EST - Some of the language.
2025/01/17 20:46:53 EST - We need to work on some of the presentations, she said. But your heart was in it. Your heart was in it. I could tell. Not my style.
2025/01/17 20:46:56 EST - All right.
2025/01/17 20:46:59 EST - But.
2025/01/17 20:47:01 EST - Basket.
2025/01/17 20:47:04 EST - Well, good call.
2025/01/17 20:47:13 EST - Yeah. Fantastic.
2025/01/17 20:47:19 EST - Is anyone like in dire straits?
2025/01/17 20:47:29 EST - And is dark shara still poisoned?
2025/01/17 20:47:32 EST - The poison condition goes away.
2025/01/17 20:47:35 EST - When it's feeling better.
2025/01/17 20:47:36 EST - Yes.
2025/01/17 20:47:39 EST - So I'll give you a moment if you want to.
2025/01/17 20:47:43 EST - Kind of reconider and regroup.
2025/01/17 20:47:53 EST - Garland says I need to give you a proper thank you. Please, let's meet back up. At 700 gams. Next rounds on me.
2025/01/17 20:48:02 EST - Says give me. Just give me just a few minutes to freshen up and I'll. Be right there. So you'll have a moment if you'd like to wander about. The market.
2025/01/17 20:48:05 EST - To heal up whatever.
2025/01/17 20:48:11 EST - Not quite a short rest for.
2025/01/17 20:48:17 EST - Late.
2025/01/17 20:48:23 EST - Your sense rN is that.
2025/01/17 20:48:26 EST - This map.
2025/01/17 20:48:30 EST - Is clearly. I mean, it's clearly a lead.
2025/01/17 20:48:31 EST - But.
2025/01/17 20:48:34 EST - It's going to require some planning.
2025/01/17 20:48:39 EST - You know that you're going to have difficulties getting past the guards.
2025/01/17 20:48:41 EST - At the Ethcliffe.
2025/01/17 20:48:50 EST - What's that?
2025/01/17 20:48:54 EST - Darling, if she can get us at the dart, yeah.
2025/01/17 20:48:57 EST - She has darted.
2025/01/17 20:49:04 EST - She's actually gone to the public bass to splash some water on her face and kind of kind of freshen up a bit.
2025/01/17 20:49:09 EST - Even at this late hour in the dark. There are people bathing in the dark.
2025/01/17 20:49:13 EST - Not to the devil.
2025/01/17 20:49:16 EST - Are there any guards bathing?
2025/01/17 20:49:19 EST - There are no guards bathing, but.
2025/01/17 20:49:22 EST - There are now two guard stationed at either end.
2025/01/17 20:49:25 EST - Just to be a presence.
2025/01/17 20:49:29 EST - Golgaron is bathing.
2025/01/17 20:49:34 EST - He reaches on into the basket and he takes out the little soaps.
2025/01/17 20:49:40 EST - In the.
2025/01/17 20:49:44 EST - Time that we're heading. Would it be possible? Would it be possible?
2025/01/17 20:49:50 EST - To go down and ask him to join our party.
2025/01/17 20:49:54 EST - You can try. Yeah.
2025/01/17 20:49:56 EST - You see?
2025/01/17 20:50:05 EST - The steps of the pool. It's like an inverted pyramid, so it gets deeper as it gets towards the center. And you see as he goes down the steps towards the center, Golgaron. Gets all the way up to his neck.
2025/01/17 20:50:07 EST - It's fairly deep.
2025/01/17 20:50:15 EST - In the center of the pool. There's go around if you want to ask him.
2025/01/17 20:50:18 EST - Yeah, we really probably shouldn't talk to that thing.
2025/01/17 20:50:21 EST - But it would be fun.
2025/01/17 20:50:29 EST - Trying to get that into the tavern.
2025/01/17 20:50:31 EST - We bring the tavern?
2025/01/17 20:50:33 EST - To it.
2025/01/17 20:50:38 EST - Probably let him settle in.
2025/01/17 20:50:41 EST - Do you not remember getting here? It's a little confusing.
2025/01/17 20:50:43 EST - It's a little bit of a hot mess.
2025/01/17 20:50:46 EST - People remember getting here. I'm very confused. You?
2025/01/17 20:50:50 EST - Is terribly confused.
2025/01/17 20:50:57 EST - Yeah. So gold run appears to be having the best baths he's had in centuries, which.
2025/01/17 20:51:01 EST - Well, yes, but it is nonetheless an excellent bath.
2025/01/17 20:51:08 EST - Around the. There are shops. There are shops of all kinds. They are currently closed.
2025/01/17 20:51:13 EST - They are currently closed.
2025/01/17 20:51:15 EST - But yeah.
2025/01/17 20:51:17 EST - You do see?
2025/01/17 20:51:25 EST - Some folks, like, the shop buildings are closed and there are people that are currently, like, rolling up. Tents and things like that.
2025/01/17 20:51:27 EST - So.
2025/01/17 20:51:30 EST - You could stop one of them if there was something in particular that you wanted.
2025/01/17 20:51:33 EST - Is there something in particular that you want?
2025/01/17 20:51:38 EST - Well, I'd like to settle my.

2025/01/17 20:51:51 EST - Yes.
2025/01/17 20:51:59 EST - You catch a person, they have all these wicker baskets full of things that are meowing.
2025/01/17 20:52:02 EST - And grunting and squawking.

2025/01/17 20:52:12 EST - It's after hours.

2025/01/17 20:56:09 EST - That paladin digi is. Meaning he has not kicked in yet.
2025/01/17 20:56:13 EST - It's only advantage against poison for.
2025/01/17 20:56:16 EST - Disease.
2025/01/17 20:56:24 EST - A lot. Or the garden, but she'll put up with it because they're still. Cute.
2025/01/17 20:56:25 EST - They're just.
2025/01/17 20:56:29 EST - Aren't the guards allergic to the cat?
2025/01/17 20:56:33 EST - Cats get distracted by the cat. Well.
2025/01/17 20:56:41 EST - How many cats are there? Four. Three. If we put four caps in the hallway ahead of us.
2025/01/17 20:56:43 EST - We'll get distracted, and then we can sneak by.
2025/01/17 20:56:54 EST - Do we know if the guards are up there?
2025/01/17 20:56:59 EST - Oh, I do think their backdrop is amazing.
2025/01/17 20:57:01 EST - That's fantastic.
2025/01/17 20:57:04 EST - That's exactly what the basket looks like.
2025/01/17 20:57:07 EST - Yeah, perfect.
2025/01/17 20:57:08 EST - Yeah.
2025/01/17 20:57:13 EST - You know that the Golden Knights are the de facto.
2025/01/17 20:57:17 EST - Military police force.
2025/01/17 20:57:22 EST - In the city. They are the ones patrolling the public, Baz.
2025/01/17 20:57:25 EST - There are several places that they kind of have, more or less.
2025/01/17 20:57:27 EST - Permanent stations.
2025/01/17 20:57:30 EST - One of those is at the close of the day, okay?
2025/01/17 20:57:35 EST - Are you asking if the ones that are stationed here currently are the ones that are.
2025/01/17 20:57:41 EST - Look the same like, did they have same uniforms? Because all the nice look.
2025/01/17 20:57:46 EST - They have impeccable golden, golden armor. Missed.
2025/01/17 20:57:48 EST - That's going to be tricky.
2025/01/17 20:57:53 EST - Mr. Swift is going to pay special attention because he wants to make.
2025/01/17 20:57:56 EST - A costume, okay?
2025/01/17 20:57:59 EST - So.
2025/01/17 20:58:07 EST - You take a good look. And as you guys are dealing with the animals, I think one of the golden knights looks over at Oren and says,
2025/01/17 20:58:13 EST - With those golden scales you'd make.

2025/01/17 21:01:26 EST - Yeah.
2025/01/17 21:01:36 EST - As you enter the, the lines dwindle down. By this point, you don't have any problem getting in. In fact, Garland has flagged a table for you. She's already seated there.
2025/01/17 21:01:38 EST - You see?
2025/01/17 21:01:43 EST - Seven gen gambler look over at you and they say,
2025/01/17 21:01:46 EST - Counterrood the sign.
2025/01/17 21:02:03 EST - Yeah, but look. It's such a cute kitty. It's a beautiful little specimen. Can we just let it go this once? But rules are rules. If we didn't have rules, what would we have? But look, let's just look at the little pretty kitty. Make a persuasion. Check.

2025/01/17 21:02:32 EST - No more new cats, just.
2025/01/17 21:02:36 EST - Five cats.
2025/01/17 21:02:39 EST - Don't make this complicated.
2025/01/17 21:02:43 EST - A meow can be heard from.
2025/01/17 21:02:47 EST - I hear nothing.
2025/01/17 21:02:50 EST - Yeah.
2025/01/17 21:02:58 EST - You guys are seated. Garland is extremely appreciative, and she says the drinks are on. Me tonight. She says within reason.
2025/01/17 21:03:02 EST - She says, I know you like to experiment, so keep it.
2025/01/17 21:03:05 EST - She says.
2025/01/17 21:03:12 EST - As thanks. She says I'm authorized by the Archkeepers Guild to give you each 20. Gold pieces.
2025/01/17 21:03:13 EST - Yeah.
2025/01/17 21:03:22 EST - I think I wrote. Yeah, we could get 40 cats each.
2025/01/17 21:03:30 EST - Time immediately.
2025/01/17 21:03:38 EST - None. Because the shop. The shop is closed.
2025/01/17 21:03:41 EST - That's a brilliant idea.
2025/01/17 21:03:46 EST - You guys.
2025/01/17 21:03:49 EST - Take a hard left on adventure and.
2025/01/17 21:03:54 EST - A cat cafe in the middle of downtown.
2025/01/17 21:04:03 EST - I don't know. Is that in the bastion section? Yes.
2025/01/17 21:04:09 EST - If I wanted to, I could get 116 cap, that's incredible.
2025/01/17 21:04:13 EST - Have you seen that crate?
2025/01/17 21:04:21 EST - Have you seen that bitch? They have a lot of cats. It's a basket of folding. It's full of £500 of cast.
2025/01/17 21:04:22 EST - Although.
2025/01/17 21:04:24 EST - Ten minutes of air.

2025/01/17 21:04:43 EST - So. Yeah, Garland says.
2025/01/17 21:04:45 EST - So.
2025/01/17 21:04:49 EST - What's next for you all?
2025/01/17 21:04:55 EST - Standing invitation to the arch keeper's guild, she says.
2025/01/17 21:04:59 EST - Some of you look like you're really into cats.
2025/01/17 21:05:01 EST - We all find our way.
2025/01/17 21:05:03 EST - We all find our way.
2025/01/17 21:05:05 EST - She says that.
2025/01/17 21:05:13 EST - Angular.
2025/01/17 21:05:24 EST - Kind of gruff, good looking, half elf with a nasty kind of scar. Green scar on his face.
2025/01/17 21:05:28 EST - Saunter is over to your table.
2025/01/17 21:05:30 EST - And he introduces.
2025/01/17 21:05:34 EST - Himself. Phil immediately hates him.
2025/01/17 21:05:38 EST - No.
2025/01/17 21:05:40 EST - Ruggedly handsome.
2025/01/17 21:05:43 EST - Tussled hair like it doesn't give a care in the world.
2025/01/17 21:05:45 EST - Just 5%.
2025/01/17 21:05:48 EST - He says.
2025/01/17 21:05:52 EST - Well. Hail the well, Matt. Adventurers, he says.
2025/01/17 21:05:55 EST - My name is maui khan vost.
2025/01/17 21:06:00 EST - I am guildmaster of the Far Span collective.
2025/01/17 21:06:06 EST - Wait, what was the name? The far span collective.
2025/01/17 21:06:20 EST - He says we need capable folk ready to deal with unusual threats. He says I'd love it if you would consider taking on future tasks under our banner. And he sets down on the table several coins. These.
2025/01/17 21:06:28 EST - Thick challenge coins through these. They're imprinted with the symbol on his brooch.
2025/01/17 21:06:30 EST - There of the far span collective.
2025/01/17 21:06:35 EST - The coins. I'll have that symbol on it.
2025/01/17 21:06:42 EST - He says these coins grant you guild membership at the Forest bank collective. I saw what you did. Today, he said.
2025/01/17 21:06:44 EST - It was fine work, he said.
2025/01/17 21:06:51 EST - You're looking for jobs of the adventurings of the adventuring sword, he says.
2025/01/17 21:06:59 EST - We aim to secure the city, he says, to uncover as much as we can about these arches.
2025/01/17 21:07:02 EST - And to deal with what lies beyond.
2025/01/17 21:07:04 EST - He says.
2025/01/17 21:07:09 EST - It's a standing invite. He says, I'm going to leave these on the table. And he says, I'll be over in the corner if you have any questions.
2025/01/17 21:07:12 EST - But I'll be by to collect these later.
2025/01/17 21:07:19 EST - Mr. Soda immediately grabs a coin and starts. He tips an imaginary hat to you.
2025/01/17 21:07:23 EST - And he says, good day.
2025/01/17 21:07:27 EST - Shale just glares him.
2025/01/17 21:07:35 EST - It develops a completely irrational dislike of person. Give me an inside check.
2025/01/17 21:07:41 EST - 13. Okay.
2025/01/17 21:07:43 EST - You're pretty sure that.
2025/01/17 21:07:45 EST - He's used to this.
2025/01/17 21:07:46 EST - Yeah.
2025/01/17 21:07:50 EST - He's used to people glaring at him.
2025/01/17 21:07:53 EST - My cat back to my coin towards that.
2025/01/17 21:07:54 EST - Pick it up.
2025/01/17 21:08:03 EST - Yeah. So that's going to conclude tonight's adventure.
2025/01/17 21:08:11 EST - You all are welcome to take Mr. Boss up on his opportunity or not.
2025/01/17 21:08:17 EST - Guild membership in the far span collective does have some benefits in terms of access to.
2025/01/17 21:08:19 EST - Items and equipment.
2025/01/17 21:08:25 EST - And, of course, a steady stream of jobs. You have the lead in your pocket.
2025/01/17 21:08:32 EST - That leads the cliffs of the dead. You can choose to share that information or not.
2025/01/17 21:08:34 EST - I'm actually kind of curious.
2025/01/17 21:08:38 EST - What you think you might do with that information about the cultists.
2025/01/17 21:08:40 EST - And so forth.
2025/01/17 21:08:43 EST - Create duplicates, spread.
2025/01/17 21:08:45 EST - Research starting point.
2025/01/17 21:08:53 EST - I'm wondering if the name of kings that died 1141 years ago has a tomb. Up in the cliff nearby, for example.
2025/01/17 21:08:59 EST - It's talking.
2025/01/17 21:09:02 EST - With those around her.
2025/01/17 21:09:05 EST - Without Neophilia talking directly to Garland.
2025/01/17 21:09:08 EST - If anyone feels comfortable.
2025/01/17 21:09:12 EST - With bringing the fact that the cultures had a note.
2025/01/17 21:09:16 EST - Is that something we could maybe get official permission to go investigate?
2025/01/17 21:09:23 EST - Okay. Garland says not to Garland. If anyone else is comfortable with also doing that, I wouldn't. Oh, got you.
2025/01/17 21:09:27 EST - Okay? Yeah. So how do you feel about that?
2025/01/17 21:09:30 EST - Mr. Soap goes.
2025/01/17 21:09:34 EST - We need permission to do? Just go up there.
2025/01/17 21:09:38 EST - It's guarded. Yes, but I can pretend to be a guard.
2025/01/17 21:09:41 EST - If we get caught.
2025/01/17 21:09:43 EST - That's on me.
2025/01/17 21:09:58 EST - I was really think I'm going to buy that?
2025/01/17 21:10:04 EST - Fighting will happen.
2025/01/17 21:10:07 EST - Wherever you started.
2025/01/17 21:10:10 EST - I'm tempted to start it now.
2025/01/17 21:10:24 EST - It's a bar room brawl. The guild master's first name? Mawacon Malacon. M a w a k a n. Lots of A's, which is actually an anagram.
2025/01/17 21:10:31 EST - So as we're sort of chatting, I'm going to sneak over to where he said we could go ask questions.
2025/01/17 21:10:33 EST - And.
2025/01/17 21:10:33 EST - Ask.
2025/01/17 21:10:36 EST - If he's ever heard of.
2025/01/17 21:10:37 EST - Anyone.
2025/01/17 21:10:40 EST - Knowing.
2025/01/17 21:10:45 EST - That a specific person or entity was coming through an arch in the past.
2025/01/17 21:10:53 EST - Has anyone known in advance that someone we know from Garland that.
2025/01/17 21:10:56 EST - There is some way to know that an arch is about to open.
2025/01/17 21:11:09 EST - But my impression from Garland was that she had no idea what or who was coming through. Just something was. Yeah. He says that's very astute. But the cult is new, right? Yeah.
2025/01/17 21:11:13 EST - To be honest, I'm a bit troubled by that myself.
2025/01/17 21:11:17 EST - He says, no, we don't typically know.
2025/01/17 21:11:19 EST - In advance.
2025/01/17 21:11:27 EST - Who's going to. So, your study of these arches you are not aware of any way to sort of.
2025/01/17 21:11:27 EST - Know.
2025/01/17 21:11:29 EST - In advance.
2025/01/17 21:11:31 EST - That a specific entity is coming through.
2025/01/17 21:11:33 EST - That's an angle that.
2025/01/17 21:11:35 EST - I've not researched personally.
2025/01/17 21:11:39 EST - He says. But of course, we do have.
2025/01/17 21:11:40 EST - Some.
2025/01/17 21:11:43 EST - Research materials.
2025/01/17 21:11:47 EST - And the Spanners hearth. That's the guild hall.
2025/01/17 21:11:50 EST - He says, should you choose to.
2025/01/17 21:11:54 EST - Partake of our guild membership because his membership has its privileges.
2025/01/17 21:11:59 EST - He says. But no, it's very astute. I also share that concern.
2025/01/17 21:12:10 EST - It does have its privileges. Does have its disadvantages. Well, you're marked us as an adventurer wherever you go. And of course, that means problems.
2025/01/17 21:12:12 EST - And, of course,
2025/01/17 21:12:18 EST - Adventure means things go sideways. They always go sideways, he says.
2025/01/17 21:12:22 EST - But.
2025/01/17 21:12:25 EST - I strive to stay ahead, to stay.
2025/01/17 21:12:29 EST - At least one or two moves ahead of the reaper, he says.
2025/01/17 21:12:31 EST - That's why I'm still alive.
2025/01/17 21:12:38 EST - Oceana tries to surreptitiously take one of the challenge points up the table. If anybody noticing.
2025/01/17 21:12:40 EST - On the floor.
2025/01/17 21:12:46 EST - You can just pick it up. Yeah, you can just pick it up.
2025/01/17 21:12:59 EST - He says it's. It's still good. It's. Yeah, it's. It's. Still good. I don't think I ruled. How big are the challenge coins? They were about like this.
2025/01/17 21:13:03 EST - Okay? Yeah.
2025/01/17 21:13:05 EST - About the same pet.
2025/01/17 21:13:08 EST - Yeah.
2025/01/17 21:13:24 EST - Aaron will pick up a John's coin and make a big show of it.
2025/01/17 21:13:26 EST - Everyone is average knows that, Arwin.
2025/01/17 21:13:29 EST - Is. Yeah. Super, super. Yeah.
2025/01/17 21:13:40 EST - So fantastic. Thank you all very much. I will present some options to you based on these leads. And via a pool.
2025/01/17 21:13:41 EST - And.
2025/01/17 21:13:46 EST - If. Our next session will be in two weeks. If you can make it, great.
2025/01/17 21:14:05 EST - If you choose. If you choose to show up, that'd be awesome. Let me know. Kind of which one of the options that you're thinking of, you might be headed towards also. Shoot me an email. Let me know if your character decides to pick up a challenge coin and take Mr. Vostop on his offer.
2025/01/17 21:14:14 EST - It is not a requirement. I'm going to also take a coin. Okay. Did you get. Challenged, pointed the size later if we want to join.
2025/01/17 21:14:18 EST - You sure can. All right, then I'll stop.
2025/01/17 21:14:19 EST - Okay.
2025/01/17 21:14:25 EST - All right. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Yeah.
2025/01/17 21:14:29 EST - Great. Exactly. Thanks, everybody. It was nice to meet you. Yeah.
2025/01/17 21:14:35 EST - We're doing experience points for this. Oh, I'm so sorry. Yes.
2025/01/17 21:14:39 EST - For tonight's efforts.
2025/01/17 21:14:41 EST - You all faced a lot of sturges.
2025/01/17 21:14:47 EST - And stared down a horn devil. You get 310 experience points.
2025/01/17 21:14:54 EST - What's the level two thresholds for experience? 300.
2025/01/17 21:14:59 EST - And 99, right?
2025/01/17 21:15:03 EST - I should have gone for that extra storage.
2025/01/17 21:15:06 EST - And.
2025/01/17 21:15:18 EST - Super.
2025/01/17 21:15:20 EST - Can we presume a long rest for these characters? Yes.
2025/01/17 21:15:28 EST - You may presume a long rest. Nothing else troubles you as you make your way from the tavern.
2025/01/17 21:15:34 EST - Garland is happy to pick up. Pick up the tab. She's super appreciative.
2025/01/17 21:15:40 EST - And, yeah. And then you look over at one point in Malcolm Mauicon, vost is just gone.
2025/01/17 21:15:47 EST - Shell weight syndrome. Everyone else is left and picked up.
2025/01/17 21:15:48 EST - Coins.
2025/01/17 21:15:58 EST - Nice.
2025/01/17 21:16:10 EST - A couple of awards.
2025/01/17 21:16:15 EST - Let's see.
2025/01/17 21:16:27 EST - I'm going to say for interacting with the cat seller, you get the not so nuby. Award.
2025/01/17 21:16:59 EST - Yeah. And I'm going to say about an RF for being so lucky, you get the Lockbringer.
2025/01/17 21:17:00 EST - Nice.
2025/01/17 21:17:13 EST - Good job, y'all. Think what it says on the cover. This was a lot of fun. Thank you. Thank you all for coming. It's great to see you. Hey, I already had.
